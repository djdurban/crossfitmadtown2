### Youth Camps

*Youth Development (Ages 8-12)*

This program is designed to help the young budding athlete to learn the athletic skills necessary to be successful at any sport. The base foundation is the most important aspect to an athlete\'s future success. This class will help your child to learn how to properly jump, run, tumble, jump rope, agility, speed development and how to properly handle their own body weight though bodyweight strength training exercises. Will improve overall athleticism.


*Advanced Youth Development (Ages 10-12)**

This training program was created for our advanced/elite youth athletes. We cover the same skills, follow the same philosophy as the youth development, but done at a faster pace and with more complex skills. Perfect for "tweens". Entry into this class by permission only.

*Must be cleared by Skipp or Keysha.*


### High School Camps

*Intro to Strength and Power Training*

We have all of our athletes start here regardless of their lifting background/experience. We often find that our style of training is a whole new beast for most athletes. We take our training programs that are normally offered to collegiate/ professional athletes, and offer them to our local youth athletes in a fun, safe, professional and supervised environment. We develop athletes by improving their: speed, power, strength, stamina, coordination, flexibility, core, quickness, agility, mental toughness and nutrition. We then enhance the athlete into a champion through work ethic, encouraging a champion's attitude as well as teaching athletes what it means to compete. Athletes will learn properly lifting technique, mechanics, breathing and body posture.


*Advanced Strength and Power Training**

This is the training program/group we want all of our athletes striving to reach. This training group is compiled of our top-tier, local, elite athletes that are college bound, preferably on scholarship. We train these athletes just like we train our collegiate & professional athletes. They WILL be one step ahead of their teammates/competition when they reach their destination. Many of our former athletes who are now college-athletes train in this training group as well!

*THIS CLASS ENTRY BY PERMISSION ONLY OR IF YOU THINK YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES, YOU CAN TEST IN*



### Conditioning Training Camps

*Speed Development*

Speed is one of the most valuable traits that an athlete can obtain. This class is taught by former division one track & field athlete/elite runner, Keysha Benzing. Her Speed Development training done in a unique way following the philosophy of Run Smarter, Not Harder. Athletes are made faster and more efficient by being taught proper running mechanics, the different phases in running/sprinting (i.e.: acceleration, drive phase, max speed), proper force application/production, start technique, running posture and what it means to compete. This undulating program uses various state of the art training techniques and tools. Training can be joined at any time allowed by the extensive progressions and is open to all athletes ages 13 and up of all ability levels from novice to elite. Benzing also has the belief that yet there are those who are natural runners, it is a skill and EVERYONE can be taught to be a more efficient, effective, faster, more explosive sprinter/runner.
