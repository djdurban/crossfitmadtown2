I have known Skipp and Keysha Benzing over 10 years and have found them to be not only
outstanding athletes, outstanding coaches, but outstanding people!  Both Skipp and Keysha excel
in the teaching of the mechanics of Olympic lifts.  Their coaching eye for spotting mechanical
errors and ways to correct these errors is above most coaches in the USA! Both Skipp and
Keysha lead by example and are perfect role models for what a coach should be and how a coach
should act.

Training this summer with Skipp and Keysha was the most physically and mentally
demanding workouts I have done and I feel that they are going to help me continue to play
basketball at a high level.  As hard as the classes are, this was the first time that I truly
enjoyed going to work out.
