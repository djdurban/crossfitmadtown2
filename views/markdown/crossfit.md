### *What is Crossfit?*

<img src="{{img1}}" alt="Girl on Rings"/>

CrossFit advocates a mix of aerobic exercise, gymnastics (body weight exercises), and Olympic weight lifting. CrossFit describes its strength and conditioning program as, constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement, with a stated goal of improving fitness, which it defines as \'work capacity across broad time and modal domains\'. Hour-long classes at affiliated gyms, or \'boxes\', typically include a warm-up, a skill development segment, the high-intensity \'workout of the day\' (or WOD), and a period of individual or group stretching. Performance on each WOD is often scored and/or ranked to encourage competition and to track individual progress.

### Do I Need Any Experience?

No previous experience is necessary! Many of our regulars started at CrossFit Madtown with little to no experience. We will guide you through each workout and help you improve your form and technique during every class. Our coaches train you in everything from strength, to agility, to flexibility, and much more.

### How Do I Get Started?

<img src="{{img3}}" alt="People Running"/>

We recommend starting with our Introduction to Crossfit class. Most members spend 8-10 weeks in our Introduction to CrossFit class before they begin in the regular sessions. However, it is not required, and depending on your athletic abilities, you may able to start regular classes sooner. The first class is free, so contact us today to sign up!
