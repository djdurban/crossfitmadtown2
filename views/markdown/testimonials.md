I have known Skipp and Keysha Benzing over 10 years and have found them to be not only
outstanding athletes, outstanding coaches, but outstanding people!  Both Skipp and Keysha excel
in the teaching of the mechanics of Olympic lifts.  Their coaching eye for spotting mechanical
errors and ways to correct these errors is above most coaches in the USA! Both Skipp and
Keysha lead by example and are perfect role models for what a coach should be and how a coach
should act.

Training this summer with Skipp and Keysha was the most physically and mentally
demanding workouts I have done and I feel that they are going to help me continue to play
basketball at a high level.  As hard as the classes are, this was the first time that I truly
enjoyed going to work out.

Besides having an incredible understanding of the physiological and mechanical
principles of lifting, Skipp has a philosophical rationale for his plan and knows not just what to do,
but why. He is patient, positive, and motivating, and knows when to push and when to back off.
He is not an “in-your- face” type of person with an ego that people have almost come to expect in
personal trainers—he is a well-educated, certified, caring, empathetic, and humble person.

Skipp received the highest marks
from our team for his success in getting us physically prepared for our championship run as we had
one of our best seasons in the history of the program under his guidance and had four players sign
Major League Soccer contracts. Skipp’s positive contributions have helped us to unprecedented
success with our program.

This box is everything CrossFit is supposed to be: high quality and expert coaching on technique
coupled with the constantly varied workouts. Because of work travel, I have been to a lot of CrossFit
boxes and Skip and Keysha are the absolute best. I have set more PRs in the 5 months I have been going
here then I had in my previous year of CrossFitting. The huge difference is not only the quality of the
coaching but the quantity - this is NOT a box where they leave you to your own as you work through a WOD
or towards a PR. Nothing escapes Skip and Keysha and they are quick to correct, adjust and motivate. The
fact that this box exists in a "smaller" market like Madison is like winning the power ball lottery because
the coaching and workouts are "big" city, professional caliber. I love this box."

In 7 months the Benzings have brought me from sedentary to Rx injury free. I've been all over
the nation now to different boxes and I commute half an hour, passing two other boxes on my route,
to get the best coaches out there."</p>

Coaches that know what they're doing, and great workouts!

I cannot give enough praise to this box and the amazing coaches who have put me through my paces.
Just over 7 months here and I have gone from fat and sedentary to winning the Madison Open Water Swim
1.2 mile wetsuit race today. 50 pounds down, feel better than I have since college and am primed to continue
pushing. Thank you so much for helping bring back my competitive spirit and giving me goals to shoot for!
